            The most important element of the study area
            is an old, dilapidated stable, which is being revitalized.
            Due to its interesting form, the facility was
            considered the main aspect of the project, imposing
            aesthetics and functional solutions in the further
            stages of work on the concept.
            During the site visit, an inventory was made on
            the basis of which the concept was created.
            The stud farm consists of a warehouse, stables,
            pastures and a riding area. Providing all the necessary
            elements for breeding horses and running
            a riding school.

            The result of this work, apart from the restored
            stable, is primarily the design of the house single-
            -family, intended for a multi-generational family
            (2+2+2 family model), binding his professional
            life with running an equestrian center.
            The house with its aesthetics refers to previously
            described stable, thanks to which it fits perfectly
            into the rural landscape and buildings Chwarszczany.
            The body of the building is covered with a gable
            roof inclined at an angle of 35 degrees. The
            facade, on the other hand, was finished with light
            brick, as was the cornice running around the building.
            The house faces parallel to the stone road
            running by the plot.
            At the entrance to the building there are utility
            rooms and a kitchen, bedrooms for the family are
            set along the side walls of the building. Living and
            dining room are central elements of the house and
            are open to a terrace and a garden from which
            you can admire a restored stable and the Chapel
            of the Templars - the compositional dominant of
            Chwarszczany.
